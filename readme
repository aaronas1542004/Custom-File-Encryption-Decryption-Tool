Custom File Encryption/Decryption Tool

🔒 Secure File Encryption/Decryption Tool (AES-256)
A command-line utility in Python for advanced file encryption and decryption. It employs AES-256 symmetric encryption with robust PBKDF2 key derivation from a user-defined passphrase, ensuring strong data confidentiality.
✨ Features
●	Encrypts files using AES-256 in CBC mode.
●	Securely derives keys from passwords using PBKDF2 with SHA256.
●	Generates unique cryptographic salts and Initialization Vectors (IVs) per encryption.
●	Supports large files by processing data in chunks.
●	Includes comprehensive error handling for file operations and password validation.
💻 Technologies
●	Python 3.x
●	cryptography library (AES, PBKDF2, padding primitives)
●	secrets module (Cryptographically strong randomness)
